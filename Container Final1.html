				<p>Figure# 1-18</p>
				<p>1650-1200 BCE</p>
				<p>Stamp-cylinder seal (“the Tyszkiewicz seal”), Hittite, 1650–1200 BCE. Combining decorative ornamentation with figurative images, this most likely portrays a ritual, possibly with a sacrificial offering on the right. It has both an image on the side, for rolling, and an image on the bottom, for stamping. Because it allows images to be reproduced, the cylinder seal can be seen as a precursor to printing. </p><br>

			  <p>My Description: I choose this image because I actually used something like this to seal my envelopes with wax and I am very surprised to see how it originated.

 </p><br>

  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because, even though its purpose and meaning is unknown, it reminded me a lot of the Aztec calendar. I can’t help but wonder if it is also something similar to the calendar.

	  <p>Li (three-legged pottery vessel), late Neolithic period. The evolution of the calligraphic character Li stemmed from this pot: oracle bone pictograph; bronze script, 1000 BCE; and regular style, 200 BCE.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I selected this image because I found it very interesting. The fact that it was the prehistoric character for the three-legged pot, which is now the word for tripod was the most interesting to me.

	  <p>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Beatus of Fernando and Sancha, 1047 CE. Unlike other interpreters of the Apocalypse, Beatus saw the first horseman as God’s envoy, whose arrows pierce the hearts of nonbelievers.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because I never really thought about people fearing the apocalypse so long ago. I am surprised that those teachings are still around now and that the four horsemen still represent War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death and that they ride forth to unleash their terror upon the world.

 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because I found it very interesting that they thought that rhinos were enemies of elephants and that they had the horn to rip through the belly of the elephant. I was sad to learn that they had placed a baby elephant in an arena to proof their theory.

	  <p>George Bickham the elder, title page for The Universal Penman. c. 1750. The Universal Penman was originally published in fifty-two sections from 1733 to 1741. The scripts of twenty-five writing masters were skillfully presented. Bickham the elder was most likely assisted in the engraving by his son, George Bickham the younger, but this has never been firmly established.

 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because I remember doing flip books with my friends when I was in grade school. We would make them and pass them around to other classmates in between periods. This image brought me some happy memories.

Rossetti, which illustrate the honeymoon of the fifteenth-century Italian king René of Anjou, grace this cabinet. The structure and ornamental carving allude to design from the medieval era.
 </p><br>

 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because it stood out to me. I found it interesting that Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec made the black spectator’s silhouettes and the really white undergarments of the cancan dancer. The white really makes the whole image pop out.

 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because it is a calendar and I love how the calendars have evolved from then to know. The font that Alfred Roller used is not one that we see in modern calendars and the border is so intricate and beautiful as well.

 </p><br>

  			<p>My Description: This is the image that I choose because I really liked how the writing was going down, I looks like the Mouse’s tail which is telling a tale in a rhythmic way and it seems as he tells the tale she getting distracted because the words are getting smaller and smaller.

	  <p>Georgy and Vladimir Augustovich Stenberg, film poster for The Man with the Movie Camera, 1929. Spatial dislocation is achieved by extreme perspective, circular type, and the fragmented figure.
 </p><br>

  			<p>My Description: This is the image I choose because I liked the three-dimensional illusions that were contrasted with flat forms of bright color in dynamic posters which conveyed strong, direct messages. It is a very unique poster

 </p><br>

	  <p>Alexey Brodovitch (art director) and Richard Avedon (photographer), editorial photographic spread from Harper’s Bazaar, July 1950. Brodovitch’s art direction is clearly seen in the cropping and use of size contrast.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because I loved how Brodovitch used contrast in size of the image to create the magazine spread and it reminded me of the layout for advertising perfumes or anything expensive in the magazines I grew up reading.

	  <p>Paul Rand, “Eye Bee M” poster, 1981. Using the rebus principle, Rand designed this poster for the presentation of the Golden Circle award, an in-house IBM occasion. Although Rand eventually prevailed, it was temporarily banned, as it was felt that it would encourage IBM staff designers to take liberties with the IBM logo.

 </p><br>

				<p>3400 BCE</p>
				<p>These Egyptian hieroglyphs illustrate the rebus principle. Words and syllables are represented by pictures of objects and by symbols whose names are similar to the word or syllable to be communicated. These hieroglyphs mean bee, leaf, sea, and sun. As rebuses (using the English language) they could also mean belief and season.</p><br>

	<p> My Description: I choose this image because I thought it was very interesting. I was fascinated with how Egyptians used hieroglyphics to communicate with others. I have never been good with deciphering the rebus phrases or words and I think it is interesting how long rebus has been around.</p>

	  <p>Figure# 3-20</p>
	  <p>1313 CE</p>
	  <p>Woodblock image of a revolving typecase, c. 1313 CE. This quaintly stylized illustration shows the revolving case designed to make typesetting more efficient.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because it looked very artistic. The attention to detail and even including educational material was very cool. I especially liked to see that we still follow the same prototype to a certain degree with modern toys by adding educational points to it.

 </p><br>

  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because I found it fascinating that the title page featured both calligraphy and typography layout. I also thought it was cool that both brothers were on the same page.

	  <p>Figure# 5-2</p>
	  <p>c. 1400</p>
	  <p>Playing cards, part of an uncut sheet of woodblock prints, c. 1400. The flat, stylized design conventions of playing cards have changed little in over five hundred years. Visual signs to designate the suits began as the four classes of medieval society.
Hearts signified the clergy; spades (derived from the Italian spada [sword]) stood for the nobility; the leaflike club represented the peas- antry; and diamonds denoted the burghers.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because I found it so interesting that the suits are the four classes of medieval society. I had never even thought about how the cards came to be and now I have a fun fact when playing cards with friends.

	  <p>Arnao Guillén de Brocar, page from the Polyglot Bible, 1514–17. The grid system developed for this volume uses uneven columns to compensate for the different running lengths of the different languages.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this picture because I found it cool looking. It just looked like a powerful image with the crown. With the stripes and the diamond squares it kind of reminds me of Mackenzie Childs who is my favorite designer.

	  <p>Lodovico degli Arrighi, pages from La operina da imparare di scrivere littera cancellaresca, 1522. The ample spaces between lines leave room for the plume-shaped ascenders waving to the right in elegant counterpoint to the descenders sweeping gracefully to the left.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: This is the image I choose because I was really intrigued by how the words descend. It is something that I have not seen before and the image really stood out to me.

 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because even though most toy books where to educate kids I found it interesting that Crane sought to only entertain children with his graphics.

	  			<p>My Description: This image I choose because so far it is my favorite image in the book. I love the way everyone could identify to this image since you don’t know which one is the male and which one is the female. I just looks like love to me.

	  <p>Paul Colin, poster for Lisa Duncan, 1935. The dancer’s movements and the shape of a grand piano are united in single art deco–inspired arrangement.
 </p><br>

	  <p>Gerrit Rietveld, model for the Schroeder House, Utrecht, 1924. A new architecture is composed of planes in a square.
 </p><br>

	  <p>Eric Gill, page from The Four Gospels, 1931. Descending type sizes, all capitals on opening lines, unjustified right margins, and initial capitals integrated with illustrations are forged into a unified whole.
 </p><br>

  			<p>My Description: This is the image I choose due to the fact that Gill used old and new and combined them together. His image looks medieval however the total design looks modern.

 </p><br>

	  <p>Rudolph de Harak, book jacket for The Stress of Life, 1963. This is one of over 350 book jackets designed for McGraw-Hill Publishers in the 1960s. Each cover conforms to a consistent format, yet the subjects are interpreted through a remarkable variety of symbolic forms and images. Here the book’s subject is implied by a knotted rope.
 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because I think the knot can represent so much and I could feel how Harak made this knot feel like stress. I usually represent this type of image with marriage and to feel different about an image that has been identified as something else I think makes it powerful.

 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because of Marilyn Monroe. She was a very controversial person and the x reminds me of modern day cancel culture. While the images on the right show her as a sex icon and how she was unafraid to use her body as a way of gaining popularity, it was a daring step to publish nude photos.

 </p><br>

	  			<p>My Description: I choose this image because it really stood out to me and made me look at it intently. There is so much in this picture that you can’t just glance at it. It looks like a scary Mickey Mouse that was made to shock people and it really did shock me.
